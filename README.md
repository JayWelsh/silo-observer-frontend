# silo.observer

### A community-lead effort to put together useful metrics & analytics for [silo.finance](https://silo.finance)

This project is a work in progress and seeks to visualize data specifically for the silo.finance project, tailored to the specifics of the project without needing to be generalised enough to display data for all DeFi platforms.

Please note that this project is not officially associated with [silo.finance](https://silo.finance).
